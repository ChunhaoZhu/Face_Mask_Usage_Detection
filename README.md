# Face_Mask_Usage_Detection

This is a team project conducted by Team StyracosaurusðŸ¦–. 

The project leverages ResNet18 CNN, transfer learning, and object detection techniques to build the model; Django and Heroku to format and deploy the website to accomplish correct face mask usage detection.

Use of face masks has become an important part of our life due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There are some guidelines to wear a mask in an appropriate way that are outlined by WHO for reducing the transmission of the virus.

The idea of this project is to correctly detect masked faces, covering nose, mouth and chin from images using Resnet18 Deep Neural Network architecture to help identify the incorrectly worn face masks and the violators.

## [Try the website here!](http://correct-mask-detection.herokuapp.com)
Choose an image to upload and the website would tell you whether the face mask is worn correctly.
